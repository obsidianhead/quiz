This includes minimal emissions and pollutants during production, use, and disposal.\n\n3. **Recyclability**: Materials should be easy to recycle at the end of their life to minimize waste and resource usage.\n\n4. **Local availability**: Materials sourced locally reduce transportation emissions and support the local economy, contributing to sustainability.\n\nIn contrast, criteria like thermal conductivity, high cost, and limited durability do not necessarily align with sustainability objectives. Thermal conductivity, while important for specific material functions, does not inherently relate to sustainability. Similarly, high cost and limited durability do not support sustainable principles of economy and longevity."
